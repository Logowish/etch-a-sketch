Etch-a-Sketch

This is an assignment of the odin project where a browser version of Etch-A-Sketch should be coded.

This webapp makes it possible to make rough sketches using different colors.

Learning outcomes:
I had the opportunity to deepen my knowledge concerning JavaScript functions, css grids and flex boxes.
Furthermore, I designed a responsive webpage without using media queries. 
However, the design could be improved for mobile devices and tablets using media queries.
